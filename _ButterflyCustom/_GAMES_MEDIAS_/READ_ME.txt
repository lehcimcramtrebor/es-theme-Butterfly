In "_GAMES_MEDIAS_" folder you can easily customize artworks for your games for this theme without loosing anything if you scrape your gamelist.


First you must create folder named by system name for each system you want to customize, if you don't know his name you can activate console
in theme to see the complete path of needed files at the bottom of the screen for your gamelist view.


In each system folder you can put files named by rom name like originally scraped images ending by:

	"-fanart.jpg" for fanarts backgrounds.
	
	"-image.png" for screenshots backgrounds.
	

	Simply way is copying images you have scraped from screenscraper from your roms folder and customize.


	For example if the name of your megadrive rom is "Alien 3 (USA, Europe) (Rev A).zip", logically the name of your scraped artworts with screenscraper will are:

	"Alien 3 (USA, Europe) (Rev A)-image.png" and "Alien 3 (USA, Europe) (Rev A)-fanart.jpg"
	
	You must use the same naming method, and your customized images will be placed in "../_ButterflyCustom/_GAMES_MEDIAS_/megadrive/"
	
	Remember custom folder must be at root of SHARE partition for Batocera or at root of Retrobat Folder if you use this last.
